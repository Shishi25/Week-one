 <h1>Software Development </h1>
 </div>
  <p> Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.</p>
   <p>It is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>
    <p> Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile.</p>
     Other methodologies include 
   <li>waterfall,</li> <li> prototyping,</li> <li> iterative and incremental development,</li> <li>spiral development,</li> <li> rapid application development,</li> <li> and extreme programming.</li>

   <h1> System administration </h1>
  </div>
  <p> System administration is the field of work in which someone manages one or more systems, be they software, hardware, servers or workstations. Its goal is ensuring the systems are running efficiently and effectively. </p>
  <p> A system administrator, or sysadmin, is a person responsible to maintain and operate a computer system or network for a company or other organization. System administrators are often members of an information technology department. </p>
  <p> The duties of a system administrator are wide-ranging, and vary from one organization to another. System administrators are usually charged with installing, supporting, and maintaining servers or other computer systems, and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems. Other duties may include scripting or light programming, project management for systems-related projects, supervising or training computer operators, and being the equivalent of a handyman for computer problems beyond the knowledge of technical support staff.</p>
  <p><h3> Duties of a system administrator </h3>
A system administrator's responsibilities typically include: <li>Morning checks of systems/software.</li> <li>Performing backups of data.</li><li>Applying operating system updates, and configuration changes.</li><li>Installing and configuring new hardware/software.</li><li>Adding/deleting/creating/modifying user account information, resetting passwords, etc.</li><li>Answering technical queries.</li><li>Responsibility for security.</li>
<li>Responsibility for documenting the configuration of the system.</li><li>Troubleshooting any reported problem or reported problems.</li><li>System performance tuning.</li><li>Keeping the network up and running.</li> </p>

    <h1>Computer programming </h1>
  </div>
  <p> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).  </p>
  <p> A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. Most computer devices require programs to function properly. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic </p>
  <p> Different programming languages support different styles of programming. The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected.
  A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as <li>BASIC,</li> <li>C,</li> <li>C++,</li> <li> COBOL,</li> <li> Java,</li> <li> FORTRAN,</li> <li> Ada,</li>  <li>and Pascal.</li> Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.

   <h1> Networking </h1> 
   </div>
  <p> Networking, also known as computer networking, is the practice of transporting and exchanging data between nodes over a shared medium in an information system. Networking comprises not only the design, construction and use of a network, but also the management, maintenance and operation of the network infrastructure, software and policies.</p>
<p>Computer networking enables devices and endpoints to be connected to each other on a local area network (LAN) or to a larger network, such as the internet or a private wide area network (WAN). This is an essential function for service providers, businesses and consumers worldwide to share resources, use or offer services, and communicate. Networking facilitates everything from telephone calls to text messaging to streaming video to the internet of things (IoT).  </p>
 <h4>Network topology</h4>

<p>Network topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.</p>

<h4>Common layouts are:</h4>
<dl>
<dt>A bus network:</dt>  
<dd>All nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead.</dd>
<dt>A star network:</dt> <dd> All nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a Wireless LAN, where each wireless client connects to the central Wireless access point.</dd>
<dt>A ring network:</dt> <dd> Each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) made use of such a topology. </dd>
<dt>A mesh network:</dt> <dd> Each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.</dd>
<dt>A fully connected network:</dt> <dd> Each node is connected to every other node in the network. </dd>
<dt>A tree network:</dt> <dd> Nodes are arranged hierarchically. </dd>
